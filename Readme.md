We are a mail-delivery book startup.
customers fill out a profile with us about their book preferences, and we will send them 5 books each month for free.
Whatever they like they keep and pay for, and whatever they don't like they send back. 
As a company we have to buy our books ahead of time. 
We took out a loan last month to buy our original batch of books. The value of the loan was the total cost of all the books that we bought.
We made some money back through customers buying our books last month.
Next month, we know which books we will be sending to which customers, but we do not know who will buy what books. 
It costs 0.60/book each way for shipping books to and from customers
